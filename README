How to use:

1) Use with firefox/chrome/chromium and Tampermonkey (recommanded)
- you have to use the firefox Chromium, or Chrome Browser (some forks may also work if tampermonkey is supported)
- the Tampermonkey-extension must be installed and activated (you should find the extension with a quick google-search)
- create a new tampermonkeyscript (click on the tampermonkey-icon in the toolbar) and copy the content of stickman_hack.js into it. Save.
- now the stickman_hack-panel should be loaded automatically wtih the stickman review-plot

2) use with javascript-console
- open the review-plot of stickman
- open a javascript-console (usually in the developement-tools of the browser)
- copy-paste the content of stickman_hack.js into the console and press Enter
- the stickman_hack-panel should appear
- this procedure must be repeated each time the review-plot is reloaded
